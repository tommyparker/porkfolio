title: Women in waste
description: This series was created for the Global Plastic Action Partnership’s feature on Amiyna, a waste picker facing gender inequality and plastic pollution. It highlights the systemic barriers women encounter in the plastics economy – unsafe work and economic insecurity – while maintaining a sense of hope and supporting the conversation on gender equity and sustainability.
